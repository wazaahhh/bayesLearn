\section*{Methods}
\subsection*{Subjects, Experiment, Treatments and Compensation}
We recruited 96 subjects ($n_{female} = ??$, $n_{male} = ??$) on Columbian University campus. The experiment took place at the social science laboratory (IRB approval : ???). Upon arrival, subjects were briefed and directed to an individual booth . The experiment was performed on a graphical  html/javascript interactive Web interface. All actions taken on the interface by subjects were recorded in real-time (resolution : $1s$). Subjects were asked to reverse-engineer the causal structure and the probabilistic relationships between nodes of an acyclic directed graph (i.e., Bayesian network). There were 2 treatments with respectively 3 and 4 nodes and their causal relationships. Participants were enabled to dynamically update their models. Participants were compensated according to their predictions and their predictions' congruence with a series of realizations.  The incentives to make good predictions were determined according to the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak method \cite{becker1964measuring}. {\bf  [The method implies a quadratic loss function.]} (See SI \ref{SI_experiment})
