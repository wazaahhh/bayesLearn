\section{Theory and Findings}

\subsection{Ultra Slow Diffusion / Power Law Decay}

The Continuous Time Random Walk Model (CTRW) of solution search predicts that the mean square displacement (MSD) of a person's model from the stochastic properties of the real system asymptotically follows $\langle \Delta x^2 (t) \rangle \sim t^{\nu}$ with $\nu = 2\beta /\alpha$. 

\begin{equation}
\label{power_law_decay}
CD(t) = C \cdot t^{-\alpha},
\end{equation}

where we estimate from our experimental data that $\alpha = 0.09$ and we find that $C$ is a constant which depends on the system that people make their inferences about; in our case, the $simple$ and $complex$ treatments. 

\begin{equation}
\label{ultraslowdiffusion}
S(t) = 1 - CD(t) = 1- C \cdot t^{-\alpha},
\end{equation}


\subsubsection{Stepwise Jumps}

\begin{equation}
P(R > \Delta r) \sim |\Delta r|^{-\alpha}, ~~with~~\alpha \approx 0.1,
\end{equation}
